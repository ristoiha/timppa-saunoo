1. Create new enum value to WindowPanel enum in Enums.cs
2. Duplicate default window panel from Assets\Prefabs\UI or any other panel that contains useful elements.

4. Duplicate DefaultWindow.cs from Assets\Scripts\UI\WindowPanels and rename the file with new window name.
5. Change class name to new window name from the duplicated (in step 4.) script (removes compiling error)
6. Open duplicated (in step 3.) window panel prefab in editor, replace DefaultWindow script component with newly created script. Build the object inside the background.
7. Set Window enum value in inspector to a new enum created in step 1.
8. Open window manager prefab from Assets\Prefabs in editor, and add new window panel prefab to Panel prefabs array.
