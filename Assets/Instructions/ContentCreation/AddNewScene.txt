Duplicate an existing scene:
- Go to Assets/Scenes folder in Project view.
- Select Museum01 scene by left clicking it.
- Press Ctrl + D to duplicate the scene.
- Give the duplicate a new recognizable name ("Museum02" for example) by renaming it (Select it, and left click it again).

Adding an enum for the scene:
- Open Assets/Scripts/Managers/SceneLoader.cs script by double clicking it in the Project view.
- Add the name of the newly duplicated scene to SceneID enum. If your scene was named Museum02, then you would add a new line "Museum02," inside the brackets.
- Save SceneLoader.cs after changes.

Adding the new scene to a build
- Navigate to scenes folder in project view (Assets/Scenes)
- Open build settings from File -> Build settings...
- Drag the new scene from the project view to build settings unde "Scenes In Build".
- Check the checkmark in "LoadingScene", "MainMenu", and your new Scene ("Museum02" for example) and remove checkmark from others.

Configure play button to start your scene
- Navigate to Assets/Prefabs/UI/WindowPanels in Project view and double click MainMenu.prefab to open it in prefab edit mode.
- In hierarchy view, navigate to MainMenu/PanelAnimator/Background/Menubuttons/PlayButton and left click it, to show its properties in Inspector view.
- Scroll down in inspector until you see a "Button Messenger (script)" component.
- Expand "Button actions" list inside the Button Messenger component in inspector view
- There should be a list item that has "Command" "LoadScene" and "Museum01". Change Museum01 to your newly added scene from the drop-down menu.
- End prefab edit mode by clicking the < arrow in the hierarchy view on the left side of "MainMenu".


After these steps, you should have a new scene created and properly configured to play in the build.
